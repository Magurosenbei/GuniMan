Graduation project developed in 2009 Q4 along with 2 developers and 1 designer. 

## Overview

GUNI MAN is a simulation role playing game with XBOX 360 as the target platform while being able to play on a Personal Computer as well. 
This game aims to provide pure fun and entertainment for all. The Player will control a Character (Karang Guni) and aim to succeed in becoming a wealthy person. 
He gains attention easily by performing his regular ‘chant’. Thus, game settings will also reflect the local environment and feel. The game also features an achievement tracker for all players to keep track of their records.

## Story
GUNI MAN has typical zero to hero storyline. The game story is non-linear and proceeds in different ways depending on the player(s). 

Story Synopsis:

Karung guni was being laughed at by some when he was digging the waste bins searching for items of worth. 
Infuriated, he swore to work hard for a better future, and to prove his worth to those who once belittled him. 
For many days and nights, he worked almost non-stop, and he succeeded in setting up his own personal garbage collection company. 
Everything went smoothly and his business expanded. He then becomes a multi-millionaire.


## Gameplay
GUNI MAN will be played from a bird’s eye view camera. The game-play like the storyline is a non-linear one. Player(s) can do whatever it takes to become a wealthy man. They start off by picking up trash on the ground or digging the waste bin for trash. Then, they will sort the trash and sell them. The game features direct selling to factories or setting up their own flea market. Player(s) can directly sell their goods to the market within their own storeroom.
Bargaining is an action available in this game. Whether collecting recyclables from NPC(s) or selling second hand goods, a good bargaining skill will have to come into play. The game AI will function in such a way that if item(s) that the player(s) are trying to sell are abundant in the market, the price they offer will be lower compared to when the particular item(s) is scarce.
With money they made from selling goods, player(s) can purchase items. An items shop will be present in the central district but is well hidden by trees. There are a variety of items available for purchase as listed above in the game elements; items section. 
In the game, all actions require stamina. A better stamina means characters can perform actions continuously over a long duration. If stamina reaches zero in any point of the game, karung guni will experience an instant knockout, so sprinting around aimlessly is not a very good idea.  Stamina recharges when player(s) stay stationary or sleep during the night. 
Also, since interaction is available, many at times the player(s) get to choose their own conversing method, own earning method etc. During conversations, English subtitles will be available at the bottom of the screen since the game characters will be communicating in a language that player(s) will not be able to comprehend. Emoticons will appear on top of the characters to express feelings and thoughts.
Game saving has never been more troublesome. GUNI MAN will require the player(s) to only save at their own storeroom. Every save requires a piece of trash paper. “You scribbled your progress on a piece of trash paper”. Therefore, saving a lot means lowering your intake.
 A live achievement tracker will be available in the game and theses achievements will be shown to the player(s) if they successfully complete the game. After which, credits will follow. Player(s) can then choose to load the game and return to the moment when they are triumph in their business and try to complete all achievements.
